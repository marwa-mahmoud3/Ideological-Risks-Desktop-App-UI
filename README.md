# 🎮 Ideological Risks - Interactive Desktop UI Case Study

> **The third professional collaboration with my ITI instructor. This project showcases my versatility in UI/UX design, moving from high-density enterprise ERPs to engaging, interactive educational interfaces for children.**

## 🌟 Project Overview
After architecting complex Pharmacy ERP systems, I was commissioned to design the **"Ideological Risks"** application for children. The challenge was to create a UI that is both educational and entertaining, ensuring an intuitive flow for users navigating through different assessment nodes.

### **Design Transformation:**
* **Demographic Shift**: Transitioned from data-heavy professional grids to a simplified, character-driven UX.
* **Architecture**: Built a multi-stage navigation system that tracks progress through four key educational phases.
* **Consistency**: Delivered high-quality visual standards for the third consecutive time with the same client.

The application is structured to guide the user through a logical progression:
1. **Introduction & Measurement**: Initial assessment and user greeting.
2. **Preparation**: Engaging setup for the learning session.
3. **Core Skills**: The main interactive training modules.
4. **Completion**: Finalizing the session and celebrating progress.
